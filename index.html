              <p>
                The じしょ form (辞書形, jisho-kei), also known as the
                dictionary form, is the basic, non-conjugated form of a verb in
                Japanese. It is called the dictionary form because it is how
                verbs are listed in dictionaries. This form is neutral and can
                be used in casual speech, typically in informal situations with
                friends, family, or peers

              <h1>ない けい</h1>
              <p>
                The ない form (ない形, nai-kei) is the negative form of a verb
                in Japanese, used to express the idea of "not doing" something
                or the absence of an action. It’s an informal way to negate a
                verb and is often used in casual conversation or when forming
                other grammatical structures, such as commands, prohibitions, or
                expressing inability.

              <h1>て けい</h1>
              <p>
                The て form (て形, te-kei) is essential verb form in Japanese.
                It is used to connect verbs, make requests and form various
                grammatical structures. It’s called the て form because all
                verbs, once conjugated into this form, will end in て or で.
                Understanding and mastering the て form is crucial.

              <p>
                The た form (た形, ta-kei) is the past tense form of a verb in
                Japanese. It is used to indicate actions or events that have
                already been completed, similar to the English past tense. The
                た form is essential for expressing past events, experiences,
                and states.

                The ます form (ます形, masu-kei) is a polite verb form in
                Japanese used to indicate respect and formality, making it
                suitable for formal or respectful conversations. This form is
                typically used in polite speech when addressing superiors,
                strangers, or in any situation where respect is required.

                desire or want to do something in Japanese. It translates to
                "want to [verb]" in English and is commonly used in both
                informal and formal conversations.
